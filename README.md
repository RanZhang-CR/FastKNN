# FastKNN
making a hardware friendly algorithm for KNN

"make run" will Run our whole KNN code which will print the avg performance for whole code and the time consuming for each RUN.
"python3 check.py" can test the correctness compared with sklearn, and also print the time consuming for sklearn.

"make run_k1" will print out our kernel1 (distance calculation) performance
"make run_k2" will print out our kernel2 (find k nearest elements) performance
"make run_k3" will print out our kernel3 (predict label) performance
